# Prompt + Tool Workflow

## Overview
This project demonstrates how prompt engineering can be used
to orchestrate workflows between an LLM and external tools
such as calculators and search.

The focus is on:
- Tool awareness
- Reducing hallucinations
- Reliable multi-step workflows

## Workflows Included
- LLM + Calculator
- LLM + Search
- Combined Reasoning + Search + Calculator

## Examples

## Why This Matters
Knowing when to delegate tasks to tools is critical for
building reliable AI systems. This project demonstrates
how prompt design can guide LLMs to use tools appropriately
instead of guessing.
